# Data Science

With the support of supplemental funding, insitutions hosting the National Library of Medicine's [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Ressearch Training Programs](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html) developed data science training materials, with the express goal of providing these materials as shareable resources for the educational community. 

Links to these resources are provided below, grouped by institution.

Social media can be a useful source of information regarding public discussion of health issues.  Using this data requires informatics strategies for retrieving, storing, annotating, interpreting, and classifying this data. 

This module challenges users to explore Twitter data, using the Python programming language, Twitter application programming interfaces, and libraries for natural language processing and machine learning.  Students will gain familiarity with the use of these tools to retrieve data, annotate data, conduct basic natural language processing tasks,  and build and evaluate simple classifier.

Students should have some background in Python programming. A Twitter developer account is required. Instructions on acquiring and configuring Twitter accounts are included.
